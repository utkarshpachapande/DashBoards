# IPL Dashboard
Excited to share my IPL Analysis Dashboard (2008–2025) built using Power BI 🎯

Although I had worked with Power BI earlier, building this end-to-end dashboard helped me brush up and strengthen my core concepts, especially:
Data modeling
DAX measures & calculated columns
Filters, slicers, and relationships
Visual design & data storytelling

🔍 About the Dashboard
 This dashboard provides a season-wise analytical view of IPL, covering:
🏆 Champion & Runner-Up by season
📊 Points Table with matches, wins, losses & total points
🔥 Orange Cap & Purple Cap statistics
💥 Most Sixes & Most Fours
📈 Key season metrics like total matches, teams, 4s, 6s, centuries & half-centuries
An interactive season slicer enables dynamic exploration across different IPL seasons.

📂 Dataset Transparency
 An open-source IPL dataset was used for this project. While it contains some inconsistencies, my primary focus was on dashboard development, DAX logic, and extracting meaningful insights, similar to real-world analytics scenarios.
 Data challenges were handled using data cleaning, logical assumptions, and custom measures.

🛠 Tools & Skills Used
 Power BI | DAX | Data Cleaning & Transformation | Dashboard Design
This project was a great learning experience and helped me revisit fundamentals while applying them practically.

Special thanks to Swapnjeet S for sharing valuable Power BI concepts and best practices, which were very helpful while building this dashboard.

Open to Data Analyst / Power BI / BI Developer opportunities and happy to discuss this project further.

 Feedback and suggestions are welcome! 😊
